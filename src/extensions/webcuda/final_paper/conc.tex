This paper introduces \namens, an extension to provide CUDA-bindings within the
JavaScript domain. \name allows computationally intensive  web applications to
leverage GPU resources for higher performance. The specification closely mirrors
the CUDA Driver API, and tries to make porting programs from the CUDA domain as
intuitive as possible.

We have implemented a version of \name on top of the V8 JavaScript JIT
Compiler.  All code and documentation has been released to the public domain to
allow developers to add any features desired. Future iterations should include
support for additional CUDA functionality to enable higher performance.

We test our implementation of \name against native JavaScript and CUDA execution
over several benchmarks prevalent in scientific computing. Overall, we achieve a
9x speedup on average over JavaScript without degrading native JavaScript performance.
