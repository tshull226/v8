This paper introduces \namens, an extension to provide CUDA-bindings
within the JavaScript Domain. \name allows programmers to improve web
application performance through allocating work to the GPU. The specification
closely mirrors the CUDA Driver API and trying to make porting programs from the
CUDA domain as intuitive as possible.

We have implemented a version of \name on top of the V8 JavaScript JIT Compiler. 
All code and documentation has been released to the public domain so that anyone
can use and modify \name as they see fit. Future iterations should include
support for additional CUDA functionality to enable higher performance

We test our implementation of \name against native JavaScript and CUDA
performance over several benchmarks prevalent in scientific computing. Overall,
we achieve a XX\% speedup over JavaScript and are within XX\% of native CUDA
performance.
