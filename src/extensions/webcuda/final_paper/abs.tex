The proliferation of web apps has lead to an increased reliance on JavaScript in
recent years. However, due to its single-threaded semantics, the performance of
JavaScript has not been able to match the demands required by computationally
intensive applications. In this paper we introduce \namens, a new way to enable
heterogeneous computing within the browser.

\name allows JavaScript programmers to launch CUDA kernels within JavaScript
code. We have extended the JavaScript language to allow for the management of
the CUDA runtime within a JavaScript program, including functionality to
allocate CUDA memory, transfer data between the JavaScript and CUDA domains,
compile CUDA code, and launch CUDA kernels. In this paper, we describe our
extension as well as \namens's implementation within a high-performance
JavaScript compiler.

We have implemented \name in Google V8 to test the
effectiveness of the JavaScript extensions within a state-of-the-art
Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler. We examine the performance of \name compared to
CUDA and JavaScript over several benchmarks prevalent in scientific computing,
evaluating both the execution time and runtime overheads.  Overall, we achieve
on average a 9x speedup over the JavaScript benchmarks without any degradation
to native JavaScript performance.
