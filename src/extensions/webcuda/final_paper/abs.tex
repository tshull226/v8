The proliferation of web apps has let to an increased reliance on JavaScript in
recent years. However, due to its single-threaded semantics, the performance of
JavaScript has not been able to match the demands required by future applications. In
this paper we introduce \name, a new way to enable heterogeneous computing
within the browser.

\name allows JavaScript programmers to launch CUDA kernels within JavaScript
code. We have extended the JavaScript language to allow for the management of
the CUDA runtime within a JavaScript program, including allocating CUDA memory,
transferring data between the JavaScript and CUDA domains, and compiling and
launching CUDA kernels. In this paper we describe our extension as well as
\name's
implementation within a JavaScript compiler.

We have implemented \name within the Chrome V8 compiler
to test the effectiveness of the JavaScript extensions within a state of the art
Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler. We examine the performance of \name compare to CUDA
and JavaScript over several benchmarks prevalent in scientific computing.
Overall, we achieve a XX\% over JavaScript and are within XX\% of native CUDA
performance.
