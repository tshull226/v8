We have implemented our \name standard within google's v8 \cite{v8} compiler. We
chose to use this compiler for implementation {\bf add stuff here}
Documentation for the full \name implementation within v8, generated with
\cite{doxygen}, can be found at 
\url{http://tshull226.synology.me/CS598SVA/doxygen/index.html}

\begin{itemize}

\item general things about the V8 API
\item general things about the CUDA Driver API
\item provide specific examples?

\end{itemize}
